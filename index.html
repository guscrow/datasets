<a href="aeo2011renewableenergygeneratingcapacityandgenerationreferencecase.csv">First dataset</a>
<p>This dataset contains data on how much energy each renewable energy source creates in the U.S. I hope to use this to create a visualization on what renewable energy sources are more efficient and practical.</p>
<a href="historicalrenewableenergyconsumptionbysectorandenergysource19892008.csv">Second dataset</a>
<p>This dataset contains data on how much energy is consumed by each sector of society. I hope to use this data to cross reference it with the renewable energy generated in hopes of finding that we don't need to depend on fossil fuels any longer.</p>
